# Spotify-Clone
This project is a frontend UI clone of Spotify created using only HTML and CSS.  
The main goal of building this project was to practice layout design, CSS styling, and responsiveness.

This is not a functional music player yet — it focuses purely on visual design and structure.  
JavaScript functionality and additional features will be added in future updates.
